# Lua assignment -- Tetris

Tetris clone made with *LÖVE*.

## Features

The game has the following features:
- **7** different colored blocks;
- multiple control schemas:
-- **keyboard** - *w, a, s, d* and *arrow keys*;
-- **mouse** - click on *up, down, left or right* side of the gird;
-- **touch** - the same as mouse but with a finger.
- saving and loading games;
- simple sound effects;
- simple animations.

It isn't the most beautiful piece of code ever written... *but it works*
